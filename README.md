CSC3003S Capstone project 

'Sell my goodsâ€™ is a desktop application that acts as an online platform where micro businesses advertise and sell their goods and buyers browse various stores in their region to purchase goods. The application aimed to improve the advertising and selling of goods for smaller business in their local area and provide a secure, convenient, efficient, scalable, and easy to use solution for micro businesses in South Africa who want to advertise and sell their goods online.

The Sell My Goods app made use of the JavaFx software platform that allowed the development team to make use of its graphics and media packages and libraries to design the user interface of the app. JavaFx Scene Builder was used as a visual layout tool to design and create the Sell My Goods interface and allowed the drag and drop of UI components onto various scenes, without any coding. All FXML code for the layout of the design are automatically added in the background. For the Sell My Goods database, the MySQL open-sourced database management system was used. The development team used this database due to its ease of use; flexibility and because it was cost efficient.
